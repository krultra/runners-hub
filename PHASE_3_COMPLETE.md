# Phase 3: Runner Search - Complete ✅

## What's Been Implemented

### Runner Search Page (`/runners/search`)

A fully functional search interface for finding runners who have competed in KUTC events.

**Features:**
- ✅ Real-time search with 300ms debounce
- ✅ Search by first name, last name, or both
- ✅ Client-side filtering for flexible matching
- ✅ Results sorted alphabetically by last name
- ✅ Displays runner count in results
- ✅ Clean UI with loading states
- ✅ Empty state when no results
- ✅ Click runner to navigate to profile (ready for Phase 4)

**Technical Details:**
- Queries `users` collection where `personId` exists (KUTC participants)
- Minimum 2 characters to trigger search
- Returns up to 50 results
- Accessibility: form fields have proper id/name attributes

**Route:** `/runners/search`

---

## Testing the Search Page

1. Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000/runners/search**
2. Enter a name (at least 2 characters)
3. Results appear automatically as you type
4. Click a runner name → navigates to `/runners/{userId}` (Phase 4)

---

## Next Steps - Phase 4: Public Runner Profile

Now we need to create the runner profile page that displays:

### Profile Page (`/runners/{userId}`)

**Components to create:**
1. `PublicRunnerProfilePage.tsx` - Main container
2. `RunnerProfileHeader.tsx` - Name and quick stats
3. `RunnerKUTCStats.tsx` - KUTC-specific statistics

**Data to display:**
- Runner name
- Total KUTC appearances
- Total loops completed
- Best performance (most loops, fastest time)
- Table of all KUTC editions participated in
- Link to detailed checkpoint analysis per edition

**Route:** `/runners/{userId}`

---

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed Phases:
- **Phase 1:** Data Import Foundation (checkpoint results in Firestore)
- **Phase 2:** Checkpoint Service & Utilities (tested and working)
- **Phase 3:** Runner Search Page (just completed)

### 🚧 Next Phase:
- **Phase 4:** Public Runner Profile Page

### 📋 Future Phases:
- **Phase 5:** Detailed Checkpoint Analysis Page
- **Phase 6:** Polish & Testing
- **Phase 7:** Future Enhancements (visualizations, comparisons)

---

## Files Modified/Created in Phase 3:

### New Files:
- `src/pages/RunnerSearchPage.tsx` - Main search page component

### Modified Files:
- `src/App.tsx` - Added route for `/runners/search`

---

## Notes:

- Search currently only finds KUTC runners (users with `personId`)
- Future: Can extend to include MO participants
- Search uses client-side filtering (Firestore doesn't support full-text search)
- For better search with large datasets, consider Algolia or ElasticSearch integration
