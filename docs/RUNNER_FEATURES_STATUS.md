# Phase 3: Runner Search - Complete ✅

## What's Been Implemented

### Runner Search Page (`/runners/search`)

A fully functional search interface for finding runners who have competed in KUTC events.

**Features:**
- ✅ Real-time search with 300ms debounce
- ✅ Search by first name, last name, or both
- ✅ Client-side filtering for flexible matching
- ✅ Results sorted alphabetically by last name
- ✅ Displays runner count in results
- ✅ Clean UI with loading states
- ✅ Empty state when no results
- ✅ Click runner to navigate to profile (ready for Phase 4)

**Technical Details:**
- Queries `users` collection where `personId` exists (KUTC participants)
- Minimum 2 characters to trigger search
- Returns up to 50 results
- Accessibility: form fields have proper id/name attributes

**Route:** `/runners/search`

---

## Testing the Search Page

1. Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000/runners/search**
2. Enter a name (at least 2 characters)
3. Results appear automatically as you type
4. Click a runner name → navigates to `/runners/{userId}` (Phase 4)

---

## Phase 4: Public Runner Profile Page - Complete 

### Highlights
- Implemented `RunnerProfilePage.tsx` to surface runner summaries, KUTC participation history, and checkpoint analysis links.
- Added `runnerProfileService.ts` for aggregating Firestore data across `users/`, `kutcResults/`, and checkpoint availability.
- Displayed top-line metrics (appearances, total loops, best performance) and per-edition tables with navigation to analysis when data exists.

### Routes & Navigation
- `/runners/:userId` added to `src/App.tsx`.
- Runner search results now deep-link directly to the profile page.

---

## Phase 5: Detailed Checkpoint Analysis Page - Complete 

### Highlights
- Delivered `RunnerCheckpointAnalysisPage.tsx` leveraging `checkpointResultsService.ts` to present summaries, performance insights, loop breakdowns, and checkpoint-level tables.
- Implemented cumulative distance/ascent metrics, formatted rest times, and corrected rank deltas for clarity.
- Linked directly from runner profiles via the Analysis column.

### Routes & Navigation
- `/runners/:userId/kutc/:editionId` registered in `src/App.tsx`.
- Home and profile flows now provide full end-to-end access from search → profile → checkpoint analysis.

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Testing - Complete 

### Highlights
- Added a runner search CTA to `HomePage.tsx` so visitors can discover stats from the landing page.
- Updated Firestore security rules to grant public read access for the collections referenced by the profile and analysis pages.
- Expanded documentation of runner features and confirmed UI navigation works across search, profile, and analysis pages.

---

## Phase 7: Navigation & Profile Enhancements - Complete 

### Highlights
- Created `runnerNavigationService.ts` to map `personId` ↔ `userId` and check checkpoint availability with caching.
- Enabled cross-navigation between runner profiles and KUTC results/analysis pages with smart fallbacks.
- Added DataGrid row instructions and click-through guidance across results pages.
- Refined runner profile participation stats to exclude `DNS` years from appearances and years list.
- Introduced an owner/admin-only personal details section on `RunnerProfilePage.tsx` with editable contact info and disabled email field with context tooltip.
- Auto-focused the `RunnerSearchPage.tsx` input to speed up keyboard-driven workflows.

### Updated Files
- `src/services/runnerNavigationService.ts` *(new)*
- `src/pages/RunnerProfilePage.tsx`
- `src/components/KUTCResultsTable.tsx`
- `src/pages/KUTCYearResultsPage.tsx`
- `src/pages/KUTCRecordsPage.tsx`
- `src/pages/KUTCAllTimeLeaderboardPage.tsx`
- `src/pages/RunnerSearchPage.tsx`

---

## Current Status

### Completed Phases:
- **Phase 1:** Data Import Foundation (checkpoint results in Firestore)
- **Phase 2:** Checkpoint Service & Utilities (tested and working)
- **Phase 3:** Runner Search Page
- **Phase 4:** Public Runner Profile Page
- **Phase 5:** Detailed Checkpoint Analysis Page
- **Phase 6:** Polish & Testing
- **Phase 7:** Navigation & Profile Enhancements

---

## Files Modified/Created in Phase 3:

### New Files:
- `src/pages/RunnerSearchPage.tsx` - Main search page component

### Modified Files:
- `src/App.tsx` - Added route for `/runners/search`

---

## Notes:

- Search currently only finds KUTC runners (users with `personId`)
- Future: Can extend to include MO participants
- Search uses client-side filtering (Firestore doesn't support full-text search)
- For better search with large datasets, consider Algolia or ElasticSearch integration

---

## Notes

- Runner search currently targets KUTC participants (users with `personId`).
- Consider extending search to other events (e.g., MO participants) and adding richer analytics in Phase 7.
- Search still relies on client-side filtering; evaluate Algolia/ElasticSearch for scalability in future work.
